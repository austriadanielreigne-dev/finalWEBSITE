# Final Steps to Publish to GitHub Pages

## Upload This Updated Workflow

Make sure to upload the updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file to your GitHub repository. This new version should work properly.

## Step-by-Step Process:

### 1. Upload Files to GitHub
- Download your project from Replit (three dots menu → Download as zip)
- Extract and upload ALL files to your GitHub repository
- **Critical**: Make sure `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is uploaded

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to: https://github.com/vooooooooooooos/blessed-umc-website/settings/pages
2. Under "Source": Select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Click "Save"

### 3. Run the Workflow
1. Go to: https://github.com/vooooooooooooos/blessed-umc-website/actions
2. Click "Deploy to GitHub Pages" 
3. Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"
4. Wait for green checkmark

### 4. Your Website Will Be Live At:
**https://vooooooooooooos.github.io/blessed-umc-website/**

## If It Still Doesn't Work:

### Alternative: Manual Upload Method
1. Build your project locally: `npm run build`
2. Download the contents of `dist/public/` folder
3. Create a new branch called `gh-pages`
4. Upload only the built files to this branch
5. Set GitHub Pages to deploy from `gh-pages` branch

### Troubleshooting:
- **Check Actions tab** for error messages
- **Ensure all files uploaded** including package.json
- **Verify workflow file** is in `.github/workflows/` folder
- **Make repository public** (required for free GitHub Pages)

## Expected Result:
Your beautiful Blessed UMC website with:
- Hero section with church background
- UMYF (Youth Fellowship) dedicated page
- Dark transparent styling
- Facebook integration buttons
- Responsive design for all devices

Will be live and accessible to everyone at the GitHub Pages URL!
