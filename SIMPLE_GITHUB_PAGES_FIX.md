# Simple GitHub Pages Fix for 404 Error

The 404 error happens because GitHub Pages can't find your built files. Here are two simple solutions:

## Option 1: Use Replit Deploy Instead (Recommended)
Since your project is complex with a full-stack setup, the easiest solution is:

1. **Use Replit's Deploy button** in your workspace
2. Click "Deploy" → "Autoscale Deployment"
3. Your site will be live at `yourproject.replit.app`
4. This handles the full-stack build automatically

## Option 2: Build and Upload Static Files
If you want to use GitHub Pages:

### Step 1: Build Your Project in Replit
1. In Replit terminal, run: `npm run build`
2. This creates files in the `dist/public` folder

### Step 2: Download Built Files
1. Go to the `dist/public` folder in Replit
2. Download all files (index.html, assets folder, etc.)

### Step 3: Create Simple GitHub Repository
1. Create a new repository called `blessed-umc-static`
2. Upload only the built files:
   - `index.html`
   - `assets/` folder
   - Any CSS/JS files

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Repository Settings → Pages
2. Source: "Deploy from branch"
3. Branch: main
4. Folder: / (root)

## Option 3: Use Alternative Hosting
Other free hosting options that work better with React:

### Netlify (Easy drag-and-drop)
1. Go to netlify.com
2. Drag your `dist/public` folder to deploy
3. Get instant URL

### Vercel (GitHub integration)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to vercel.com
2. Automatic deployment with every push
3. Works perfectly with React/Vite

## Why the 404 Happened
- GitHub Pages expects an `index.html` in the root
- Your build creates files in `dist/public/`
- The GitHub Action wasn't finding the correct path
- React routing needs special handling for GitHub Pages

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Try Replit Deploy first** (simplest)
2. If you need GitHub Pages, use Option 2 above
3. Consider Netlify/Vercel for better React support
