The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build failure is caused by the command `vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist` not being able to find the `vite` executable, resulting in an exit code 127.

### Solution
1. The error indicates that the `vite` command is not found. This can happen if `vite` is not installed or available in the project dependencies.
2. To resolve this issue:
   - Add `vite` as a devDependency in the `package.json` file by running:
     ```bash
     npm install vite --save-dev
     ```
   - Ensure that the `vite` package is included in the `package.json` file or committed to the repository.
   - After adding `vite` as a devDependency, the build should be able to find the `vite` executable and complete successfully.

Make sure to follow these steps to resolve the issue and successfully build the project.
